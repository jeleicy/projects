	'parrafo1' => 'En términos generales, este perfil de Orientación Laboral muestra una perspectiva indefinida, (un tanto confusa o conflictuada) propia de un profesional que se encuentra en una etapa de transición, aún no completada del todo, por factores de diversas índoles (personal / laboral).	',
	
	'texto_principal' => 'People with this profile are perceived as determined, logical, tenacious and ostensibly independent.  They are friendly but generally distant; they tend to be thoughtful but don’t doubt to categorically and directly express their opinion.  Being curious and analytical, they enjoy following clues, deciphering codes, searching for facts and discovering somewhat confusing meanings. They evaluate circumstances objectively and without passion.  They prefer to work patiently instead of urgently, their efficiency lies in hours of work rather than in flames of inspiration.',
	'texto_iniciativa' => 'This profile is basically obstinate, suspicious, parsimonious and stubborn.  In their daily activity, they need to be independent and questioning. Being conscientious, they prefer to work alone and move at their own way and pace. They formulate more conjectures than conclusions and questions whoever looks “over their shoulders”. They prefer to work with things and specific facts rather than getting too involved with people.',
	'texto_implicaciones' => 'The “Auditor” is incredulous about what they observe superficially, skeptical of people’s intentions and they continually feel threatened by problems that are not solved or remain latent. They have little interest in pleasing others and end up being abrupt, tactless, stubborn and obstinate.  It’s difficult to influence them or make them change their point of view, once they’ve made a decision or taken a position. In general, they’re not good at convincingly persuading others or generating enthusiasm, because of their strong tendency to “give orders” and towards “duty”.',
	'texto_supervision' => 'This profile despises the affectionate and emotional side. Suppressing or sublimating emotions due to certain moral principles and values is a source of pride for their rationality, objectivity and analytical character. They’re inflexible in their determination to overcome difficult problems. They react positively to a direct and honest supervisor: “tell me what you want me to do and then, let me do it alone”. This is a strong profile, with little fear of confrontatio',
