	'parrafo1' => 'En términos generales, este perfil de Orientación Laboral muestra una perspectiva indefinida, (un tanto confusa o conflictuada) propia de un profesional que se encuentra en una etapa de transición, aún no completada del todo, por factores de diversas índoles (personal / laboral).	',
	
	'texto_principal' => 'People with this profile are perceived as calm, friendly, relaxed and helpful.  Usually, they tend to be accepted unconditionally, and they are very easy to get along with.  People spontaneously share their concerns with this profile, which in turn tends to offer indirect and informal suggestions.  Their self-confidence, modesty and control make them very pleasant people.',
	'texto_iniciativa' => 'This profile is patient, humble, receptive and constant.  In their daily activity, they always show friendliness and good personal treatment.  They enjoy working with the people they know and they spontaneously help them in a quiet and serene environment.  They’re sociable by nature, hate to be alone or work on their own.  Being understanding and good-humored, they tend to teach, assist and support with patience and a lot of consistency.',
	'texto_implicaciones' => 'The “Advisor” wants to have the courage to set limits, but has difficulty saying when to give in and when to challenge, stop or persist, reject or help.  It bothers them to give direct orders.  They treat other coworkers slightly; and if they ever got mad about something, they’d find the way to apologize and make things up.  They could bear a grudge against and feel some resentment for those who criticize them or don’t let them do things their way.',
	'texto_supervision' => 'This profile responds best to a democratic and relaxed supervisor.  Since they are oriented towards calm environments with predictable work cycles, they don’t perform well in environments with a tense and threatening atmosphere. You need to be tactful to express them recognition for a job well done.  They prefer short and specific messages and a personalized and in-private attention.  They require periodic indications to establish and reach their work goals in a realistic manner.',
