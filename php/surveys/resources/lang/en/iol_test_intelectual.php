	'parrafo1' => 'En términos generales, este perfil de Orientación Laboral muestra una perspectiva indefinida, (un tanto confusa o conflictuada) propia de un profesional que se encuentra en una etapa de transición, aún no completada del todo, por factores de diversas índoles (personal / laboral).	',
	
	'texto_principal' => 'People with this profile are perceived as big experts in their technical discipline, reliable, rigorous and methodical in their work. They’re usually cold and distant in their daily working relationships, absorbed in their work and unconcerned about their surrounding reality. The teams they work best with have to be fast and precise when following their directions, and their requirements are usually demanding and continuous. They establish very high performance standards and extend them equivalently to everyone around them and related to their management. They tolerate periods of uncertainty and persevere in their tasks for long periods of time regardless of the short-term results they obtain.',
	'texto_iniciativa' => 'This profile is characterized by being analytical, deep, disciplines and having a systematic and global perspective. Their decision-making is based on rigorous analysis, supported by observable data and quantifiable information, more than on intuition and emotions of the moment. They often prefer to work independently, and when working in groups, they’re usually objective and diplomatic handling disagreements. They’re meticulous planning their tasks to avoid any risk that might unnecessarily expose them. They give up a taken position to avoid further controversies.',
	'texto_implicaciones' => 'Since the “Intellectual” is considered “a scientist” or “academic”, they are treated with certain distance and seldom emotionally close. However, they are admired for their professional credentials. In other cases, the way they express themselves and their technical-scientific jargon cause constant complaints and claims, especially in the commercial and operational areas. They privilege the world with ideas, theoretical models and refined thinking, as opposed to practical solutions and simple answers to put into practice. They need excessive time to review, adjust and keep polishing their proposals, often neglecting the cost/benefit relationship. In some cases, their rigorous methodology usually tends to be interpreted as personal rigidity and obstinacy.',
	'texto_supervision' => 'This profile needs a supervisor who helps them put their work into context. The value they add to a business can be far from the established priorities, their demands are usually excessive for the projects’ assigned resources and established time. Their source of satisfaction and pride is confined to the satisfaction and results of the job itself; other acknowledgements are considered a mere formality.  When threatened, they tend to become defensive and get stuck in their analysis.',
