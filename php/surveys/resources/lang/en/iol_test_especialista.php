	'parrafo1' => 'En términos generales, este perfil de Orientación Laboral muestra una perspectiva indefinida, (un tanto confusa o conflictuada) propia de un profesional que se encuentra en una etapa de transición, aún no completada del todo, por factores de diversas índoles (personal / laboral).	',
	
	'texto_principal' => 'People with this profile are perceived as reliable, loyal and balanced.  They don’t get upset about circumstantial adversities; they’re characterized by their self-control, patience in the management of others, a big concentration capacity and a willingness to take other people’s desires into account without violating the established standards and norms.  They show a strong inclination towards service and towards a conservative and consistent leadership.  Although calm, they accomplish their results through persistence and the use of techniques that “have worked in the past”.',
	'texto_iniciativa' => 'Since this profile does things in a very refined manner, challenges are little attractive and practically unacceptable.  They want to work in predictable and methodic environments, with time to do things right and offer an authentic good service to others.  They prefer stable situations because of their specialized skills and knowledge that require time to achieve such high performance levels.  They expect people to ask for their service or they offer it in cases of already established relationships.  Bureaucracy prevails in their activity management.',
	'texto_implicaciones' => 'The “Specialist” tends to be moderate, conservative and honest, oriented towards offering an impeccable service, even though they are slow to respond to the new and different. They tend to meet their delivery deadlines through long working hours and usually take a long time to make decisions. Although they are loyal and reliable, they’re also possessive of their position, things and relationships. They tend to be resentful against intruders or competitors, and slow to give in to opposite positions or points of view.',
	'texto_supervision' => 'This profile prefers an understanding supervisor who shows a sincere appreciation of their effort and work quality; as well as being willing to sporadically guide and offer recommendations. They need a wider margin to make changes or reach ambitious goals; it’s not enough to know what is expected from them.  They need someone to establish specific priorities, offer technical options and give an unconditional support in their opportunity areas.  They appreciate being taken into account and kept informed; however, they participate very little in those meetings and don’t usually volunteer to take part in some new project or particular assignment.',
