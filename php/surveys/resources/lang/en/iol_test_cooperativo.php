	'parrafo1' => 'En términos generales, este perfil de Orientación Laboral muestra una perspectiva indefinida, (un tanto confusa o conflictuada) propia de un profesional que se encuentra en una etapa de transición, aún no completada del todo, por factores de diversas índoles (personal / laboral).	',
	
	'texto_principal' => 'People with this profile are perceived as reserved, friendly, predictable and in control. They tend to keep environments that are familiar to them and maintain close relationships with a few and selective people, although they fit in with everybody.  They show themselves as soft, calm, relaxed and serene and they like to act at a deliberate pace, avoiding surprises or unexpected turns.  They perform in a uniform and constant way; they’re practical and equable, and down to earth.  They persevere working long hours to fully meet their commitments.',
	'texto_iniciativa' => 'This profile prefers to do things with patience and precision, they have modest and realistic aspirations. In their daily activities they concentrate on the current task, which they try to perform with clearly established guidelines, no matter how routinely and repetitive they can become. They do only one thing at a time and need to fully complete it.  They like to work in the same place, taking few decisions, based on the idea that problems are solved by time rather than specific actions.',
	'texto_implicaciones' => 'The “Cooperative” tends to be modest, of possessive nature and with minimal aspirations to stand out with their work.  They mostly feel at ease where they are rather than where they could be; in essence, they are traditionalist and reluctant.  They talk about “past and much better times. They maintain the status quo to adjust to changes.  They can be resentful and over time, they could take revenge.  They’re slow to take the initiative and very unwilling to delegate any task to others.',
	'texto_supervision' => 'This profile prefers a relaxed and friendly supervisor. They want to work for “a friend”, with no need of receiving any special attention or acknowledgement for their contributions.  Due to their search of   familiarity, they need to get prepared for changes and feel that what they’re doing is worth it. Once something has been started, they can work on it with constancy, having detailed instructions and support to overcome the initial resistance.',
