	'perfil' => 'Invalido',
    'titulo_iol' => 'Inventario de Orientacion Laboral',
	'parrafo1' => 'En términos generales, este perfil de Orientación Laboral muestra una perspectiva indefinida, (un tanto confusa o conflictuada) propia de un profesional que se encuentra en una etapa de transición, aún no completada del todo, por factores de diversas índoles (personal / laboral).	',
	
	'texto_principal' => 'People with this profile are perceived as highly competent, nice and adaptable.  They have high quality awareness. They set high standards for themselves and expect the same from others.  They’re admired for their exemplary conduct, their sense of justice and their discipline. During negotiations they are clever, conservative and they usually impose their truth and line of arguments.  They’re strict as supervisors, meticulous as teachers and systematic as technicians in their specialty area.  Their diplomatic style lies in the fact that they make very few mistakes and make no enemies during their tasks.',
	'texto_iniciativa' => 'This profile is characterized by wanting everything to go well for themselves, being right and avoiding controversies and criticism, no matter where those come from.  They want to know the rules of the game and be among supportive coworkers, rather than challenge the existing status quo. They tend to “shelter from the storm”, have systems they can make use of or manuals to follow.  In case they don’t have those, they will develop and install them, in order to manage work plans and people according to the “established”.  They don’t want mistakes and desire a first-quality production in a comfortable and respectable environment.',
	'texto_implicaciones' => 'Since they are willing to adapt, the “Expert” can make too many concessions.  Even though they are strict and fair, they can be “easy prey” for the more reluctant cooperators and clients due to their tendency to give in to keep the peace.  Although organized and very disciplined, they tend to lack the necessary beyond-the-short-term vision and to lose the global overview. Their obsession with precision and detail make them lose time, and their decisions are slow waiting for more information or documentation to support them.',
	'texto_supervision' => 'This profile needs a supervisor who gives clear and concise guidelines. It’s essential to them to have a total comprehension of their position’s expectations, standards and key procedures. They require assistance and reinforcement when clients or cooperators cause them trouble; this will help them to recover their self-confidence. What will help them adjust their friendly manner and their efforts to please, are: more in-depth explanations; more structured answers about goals, work-plan strategies and about how to “improve” their performance.',
