',
	
	'texto_principal' => 'People with this profile are perceived as daring and intrepid.  They take firm positions on controversial issues and they have the courage to be different. They want to “run the show” and seek to win at any cost.  Generally, they assume the role of a “leader” who goes forward, leading the way, giving sense to the action.  They tend to be individualistic and have so much “self-confidence”, that they’re usually perceived as innovative.  Being valiant and not feeling threatened by the new and different, they try whatever is necessary and expect others to do the same.',
	'texto_iniciativa' => 'This profile is independent and obsessed with freedom, and above all wants the opportunity to achieve anything they intend.  They identify where there is little structure or the power to do the things they choose.  They seek to have an “overall view”, but with the right to make modifications in function of their own needs and interests.  Strongly individualistic, with freedom to manage the available resources, and to be judged according to their results.',
	'texto_implicaciones' => 'The “Organizer”, being a true doer, also has the potential to be a troublemaker.  They enjoy constant confrontation and are not very conscious about the damage they’re causing with that.  They’re very demanding with their co-workers and their judgment tends to be blind when it comes to the collateral effects of their taken initiatives.  They tend to be very determined, confident, impetuous and arbitrary, and therefore, to assume too many risks.  The inefficiency, due to their relative aversion to detail and their neglect of established systems and procedures, can cause their own ruin. ',
	'texto_supervision' => 'This profile needs to be challenged, but also regularly confronted.  It’s not enough to ask for their cooperation and participation; this has to be done formally (well defined rules of the game).  They need to receive support with systems and procedures, so that their potential errors cause the least amount of negative implications or are detected on time to avoid major consequences (with prudence in the human relations).  This profile needs autonomy, promotion opportunities or room to maneuver due to their individualism and drive.',
