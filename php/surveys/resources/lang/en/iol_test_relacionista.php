	'texto_implicaciones' => 'The “Networker” tends to be mainly criticized for being conventional in their behavior and for being too uninhibited.  Their ease to interact with others and their challenging position towards risks, make them suspect of a “hidden agenda”.

They tend to be too optimistic and rely too much on people, which diminish their capacity to control and follow up on projects.',
	'texto_supervision' => 'This profile prefers a friendly and communicative supervisor, instead of someone rigid or impersonal.  They enjoy working with moderate or very little structure.  They love to work in situations that imply persuading people or to intensely interact in work situations. They’re motivated by frequent public recognitions, as well as by visible symbols of their success and public announcements to express how appreciated their work is.  In assignments, they prefer to be acknowledged as a leader and not a follower.',
