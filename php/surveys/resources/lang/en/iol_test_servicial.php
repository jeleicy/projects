',
	
	'texto_principal' => 'People with this profile are perceived as systematic, precise and oriented towards giving unconditional support.  They like and encourage the familiar, the routine and stability. In the activities under their responsibility, they show a high disposition towards analysis and reflection.  People are important to them, especially to gain their trust and support.  The make very few mistakes and never twice the same, due to their strong adherence to established norms and procedures.  Even though they persevere in their tasks, they have very little sense of urgency and low ability to work under pressure',
	'texto_iniciativa' => 'This profile prefers to do things “quietly”, unnoticeably, with a highly rigorous performance, avoiding inadmissible clerical errors.  They want to know where to find the answers they need, who to turn to and where the experts are.  If there is no detailed work procedure, they will establish one and make it formal, in order to ensure reliable results.  Their effort has to be rewarded and their workplace has to offer them the opportunity to feel pride.',
	'texto_implicaciones' => 'Due to their high dependency on existing work procedures, the “Helpful” doesn’t like to change the status quo. Insisting very much on quality can be counterproductive because of their lack of sense of urgency.  Their strength of character comes from their obstinacy to comply with norms and rules the way they know and manage them. They delegate temporarily due to their strong possession of their job, and time administration is a constant obstacle since they tend to work in a concentrated and continuous manner on one project or issue at a time.',
	'texto_supervision' => 'This profile prefers a very precise, structured and stable supervisor. They require a clear and well-defined description of their responsibilities, well-established deadlines and norms specified with a lot of detail. They prefer a big amount of information and best of all, if it’s written.  They expect long explanations about their job and want to feel that what they’re doing is really crucial. They doubt and hesitate at risks; they are a most frequent source of frustration.',
