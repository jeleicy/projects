	'parrafo1' => 'In general terms, this Labor-Orientation Profile shows an indefinite perspective (a little confused or conflicted) typical of a professional who is in a transition stage, not yet completed, due to several types of factors (personal/ labor related).',
	
	'texto_principal' => 'People with this profile are perceived as firm, convincing, realistic, impatient and independent.  They fight to overcome obstacles and accomplish their established goals at any cost, often in obsessive terms.  They prefer to face difficult issues and problems, to solve them with determination, using different tactics. They tend to be competitive and like to manage things their way, which they consider best of all.  They’re very willing to assume challenging responsibilities and to take decisions independently.',
	'texto_iniciativa' => 'This profile is dominant, incisive, active and very determined.  During their daily activity, this person shows a need to initiate actions, exercise authority and produce tangible results in the agreed terms.  They tend to be individualistic, a loner who wants and needs power as well as freedom.  They function better in fast- paced and highly competitive environments.  The more challenging and important the issue to take on, the bigger will be their interest.',
	'texto_implicaciones' => 'The “Initiator” has a much bigger impact on others than they realize.  When people don’t meet their expectations, they will say so directly and off-handedly. Due to their impatience to get things done, they won’t hesitate to do them on their own if necessary.  There is a risk they will get impatient and irritable when things don’t go according to the terms and standards, which they themselves established unilaterally.',
	'texto_supervision' => 'People with this profile function best with a direct and clear supervisor with whom they can negotiate commitments as equals.  Due to their desire for variety and difficulty, this profile needs tasks that imply an interesting challenge that appeal to logic and that are of analytical nature.  Personal interaction can be improved by increasing their conscience with tasks that surpass their own abilities and technical knowledge.  ',
