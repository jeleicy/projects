',
	
	'texto_principal' => 'People with this profile are perceived as energetic, objective, determined and systematic.  They tend to have a high intellectual level but to be a little unorganized in their action performance.  They thoroughly investigate facts and search for plausible and high-quality solutions, frequently generating new approaches and innovative ideas that imply a substantial improvement.',
	'texto_iniciativa' => 'This profile seeks to achieve their personal goals and tries to reach them in a way that allows personal satisfaction.  They are eager to please others, to gain popularity and recognition, as well as to have a lot of freedom and autonomy to act the way they want, at their own pace.',
	'texto_implicaciones' => 'When working close to an “Entrepreneur”, this person can be exciting for some and exasperating for others.  They look for results with one foot on the throttle and the other on the brake, which makes them cold, distant, tense, self- critical and too serious in their matters.  They tend to hesitate and to look things over and over again, which leads to work in an untimely manner rather than at a steady pace.',
	'texto_supervision' => 'This profile can undertake actions and decide to do so when least expected, and then consult and delay even when there are enough reasons to move on.  This unpredictability tends to confuse his coworkers who can’t always put the best ideas that come up into practice. The “Entrepreneur” needs a supervisor who knows them well, to help them close ongoing projects and start new ones.',
