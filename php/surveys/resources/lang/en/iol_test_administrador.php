	'parrafo1' => 'En términos generales, este perfil de Orientación Laboral muestra una perspectiva indefinida, (un tanto confusa o conflictuada) propia de un profesional que se encuentra en una etapa de transición, aún no completada del todo, por factores de diversas índoles (personal / laboral).	',
	
	'texto_principal' => 'People with this profile are perceived as structured, stable, disciplined and reliable for the new approaches and procedures they’re responsible of launching and promoting.  They’re receptive to the work environment’s needs and changes and demanding with the tasks’ precision and quality.  Their management is supported by reliable information sources that allow them to keep a strict programming and structure of the activities under their control. They have a detailed knowledge of the fundamentals that underlie their management practices, and they appropriately assist those who ask for their help and support.',
	'texto_iniciativa' => 'This profile is characterized by directing their activities based on well-conceived norms and procedures, that are structured according to solidly founded approaches and to the knowledge imposed by their professional training. They seek to conciliate the results’ quality requirements and adherence to standards, with the needs and conditions of the people around them. They make decisions based on the experience of known facts and logical judgment, which they then translate into rigorous criteria that contemplate the valid politics and guidelines.  Facts are more important than intuitions and logic than people’s feelings and opinions.',
	'texto_implicaciones' => 'The “Administrator” tends to stick to methods and procedures which influence their work pattern.  They hesitate before acting without precedents; they want complete explanations and a detailed comprehension of issues before initiating any type of change. They resist accepting total responsibility, they depend on a supervisor’s   authorization when the logical coherence of matters fails, and they get defensive when feeling threatened. They strictly adopt systems and controls that allow them to reduce risks and unexpected incidents, but that reduces their time of response to take advantage of opportunities and to quickly and appropriately respond to new demands',
	'texto_supervision' => 'This profile needs a supervisor who offers a broader perspective to their approaches and lines of work that are related to a general management framework. They appreciate receiving help and a vote of confidence, to be more independent and autonomous in their decision making. They like to get involved in projects where their initiative and skills will be valued, rather than in those that are exclusively centered on details and very short response times. They prefer to participate in meetings where they can suggest ambitious lines of action, rather than passively receiving conventional job directions and guidelines.',
