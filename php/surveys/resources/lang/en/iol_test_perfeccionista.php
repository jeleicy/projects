	'texto_implicaciones' => 'The “Perfectionist” tends to be impeccable in their matters.

They hesitate to act on their own initiative and anxiously expect a supervisor’s directions to get into action. Since they feel uneasy about antagonism, they avoid direct confrontation with others',

They need support and backing in difficult situations. They prefer to participate in decision-making processes, rather than just knowing what is expected from them. They function very well in tasks that require planning, attention to detail, precision and organization.',
